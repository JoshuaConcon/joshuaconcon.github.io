   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello there! My name is of course Joshua Concon and this is my very first blog post where I plan to hopefully be able to log and comment about my experiences as a CS Student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I will be trying to post monthly about my thoughts and short essays I feel like writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not entirely sure what exactly I’m interested in, but I see that as a good thing in that I am open to trying all sorts of fields. Although I’m primarily interested in Computer Science, it’s applications are pretty broad allowing me to explore my options.&lt;/p&gt;
