   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello there! My name is of course Joshua Concon and this is my very first blog post where I plan to hopefully be able to log and comment about my experiences as a CS Student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I will be trying to post monthly or more frequently provided that coursework does not overwhelm me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am enrolled in the Computer Science Specialist: Comprehensive Stream as well as a Major in Mathematics, which many have told me that I will end up hating my life due to how theoretical it all is, but it seem pretty good so far. I barely made it into the program from first year due to my horrendous grades, however I have brought them up last summer, allowing me to enter into POSt.&lt;/p&gt;
