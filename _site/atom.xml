   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a now second year student Computer Science student just finishing up the mandatory B-level CS courses for my program (provided I don’t fail anything lol) I often look back at my first year and how different both experiences ended up being. I ask myself, where did it all go wrong?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways here’s a quick outline of all the courses I took in First Year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;csca08---introduction-to-computer-science-i&quot;&gt;CSCA08 - Introduction to Computer Science I&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of 2017, this is the newest building on campus, and it really shows. This building is super clean, well maintained, and reportedly hosts the fastest wifi connection speeds on campus (right in the middle where the couches are).&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello there! My name is of course Joshua Concon and this is my very first blog post where I plan to hopefully be able to log and comment about my experiences as a CS Student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I will be trying to post monthly about my thoughts and short essays I feel like writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not entirely sure what exactly I’m interested in, but I see that as a good thing in that I am open to trying all sorts of fields. Although I’m primarily interested in Computer Science, it’s applications are pretty broad allowing me to explore my options.&lt;/p&gt;
