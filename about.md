Hey there! My name is Joshua Concon and I'm a Second Year Computer Science Student at the University of Toronto!

I love Computer Science and Math enough to spend a lot of money each semester learning them. I also enjoy reading and discussing geopolitics, economics, and history.

More importantly, I really like lemon tea. All other teas are tasteless compared to it.
