Hi, as of 2016, I am a second year computer science student at the University of Toronto. I am currently interested in Machine Learning algorithms as well as Artificial Intelligence (mostly from watching the Student Starcraft AI Tournament). I won't say I'm super proficient in any kind of programming language yet (other than python from introductory courses), but I'm always trying to learn new things for my side projects.

I am also fascinated with post-modernism and irony in a comedic sense, and I also know a lot about various internet cultures.
