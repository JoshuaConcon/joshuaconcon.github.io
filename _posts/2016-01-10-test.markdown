Finally got to actually setting up this website.

Hi, I'm Joshua Concon, and undergraduate student at the University of Toronto.

On this blog, I will be posting about my experiences as a Computer Science student, as well as giving advice on what to expect to prospective students to UofT and CS in general.

Ya that's it really.
