Hello there! My name is of course Joshua Concon and this is my very first blog post where I plan to hopefully be able to log and comment about my experiences as a CS Student at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I will be trying to post monthly or more frequently provided that coursework does not overwhelm me.

Currently, I am enrolled in the Computer Science Specialist: Comprehensive Stream as well as a Major in Mathematics, which many have told me that I will end up hating my life due to how theoretical it all is, but it seem pretty good so far. I made it into the program from first year summer due to my 'meh' grades, however I have brought them up last summer, allowing me to enter into POSt.

I am not entirely sure what exactly I'm interested in, but I see that as a good thing in that I am open to trying all sorts of fields. Although I'm primarily interested in Computer Science, it's applications are pretty broad allowing me to explore my options.
