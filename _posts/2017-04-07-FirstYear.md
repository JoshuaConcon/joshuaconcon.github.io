title: First Year at UTSC
---

As a now second year student Computer Science student just finishing up the mandatory B-level CS courses for my program (provided I don't fail anything lol) I often look back at my first year and how different both experiences ended up being. I ask myself, where did it all go wrong?

Anyways, here's a quick outline of all the courses I took in First Year.

This is essentially UTSC's CS50. Your basic introduction to programming and the basics of good software design. This course is meant to somewhat level the playing field a bit as there might be people with loads of coding experience as well as those who have never touched a computer before in the pool of incoming UofT students, and it does this by explaining the basic concepts of coding in the first few weeks (ie. Variables, Loops, Functions, etc.) and then dives into memory model, objects, mutability, ADTS, Debugging, Test Cases, and recently, UML and Complexity (Winter 2017 had a difficult UTM prof teaching it then).

The assignments really get you to think as they aren't something you can just rush into, but you have to stop for a second and really understand what is being asked of you. Class time consisted of 3 hours of Lecture, 1 hour of tutorial, and optional Practical and Anti-Lecture sessions to clear up any problems and confusion that you may have with course concepts. However, like most optional things, Practicals and Anti-Lectures are barely used so it's pretty chill.

I had prior coding experience walking into this course, so it was pretty easy imo, but anyone wanting to prepare for this course can easily take CS50 at edX or a similar introductory CS course online.

The course for me was taught by [Dr. Brian Harrington](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvBdH5AKlNc), I think his TED Talk speaks for itself.

If you haven't taken Data Managment in High School, half of those is basically that. Combinations, permutations, basic probability, essentially everything you need to solve common math riddles, at least that's how I saw it anyways.

Besides this, you will also learn
